# Learning-Behavior-Impact-Analysis-Performance-Prediction-Power-BI
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes how student learning behaviors and lifestyle factors influence academic performance using Power BI. The goal is to transform raw student data into actionable insights that help educational institutions, EdTech platforms, and training organizations identify performance drivers, predict at-risk students, and enable early interventions.

🎯 Business Problem

Educational institutions collect extensive student data but often struggle to:
Identify which learning behaviors impact performance the most
Detect at-risk students early
Convert behavioral data into actionable decisions
This project addresses these challenges by applying data analytics and visualization techniques to support proactive, data-driven decision-making.

📂 Dataset Description

Data Type: Structured CSV dataset
Records: ~900+ students
Granularity: Student-level data

Key Features:

Academic Performance: Exam Score
Learning Habits: Study Hours per Day
Attendance: Attendance Percentage
Lifestyle Factors: Sleep Hours, Social Media Usage
Demographics: Age, Gender
Employment: Part-Time Job Status

Tools & Technologies Used:

Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, DAX, dashboard development
Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – KPIs, calculated measures
CSV Dataset – Source data

Project Workflow:

1️⃣ Data Understanding & Requirement Analysis

Reviewed dataset structure and variables
Identified key performance indicators required by stakeholders

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)

Removed duplicate records
Handled missing and invalid values
Standardized numeric and categorical fields
Created derived columns such as Performance Level

3️⃣ Data Modeling

Optimized student-level data model
Created relationships and measures for efficient aggregation

4️⃣ DAX Measures & KPIs

Key metrics created:
Total Students
Average Exam Score
Average Study Hours
Average Attendance Percentage
Percentage of High Performers

5️⃣ Performance Segmentation

Classified students into High, Medium, and Low performance levels based on academic and behavioral patterns

6️⃣ Behavioral Impact Analysis

Study Hours vs Exam Score
Attendance Impact on Performance
Screen Time vs Academic Performance
Lifestyle and demographic comparisons

7️⃣ Risk Identification & Prediction

Rule-based logic to identify at-risk students using:
Low attendance
Low study hours
Low exam scores

📊 Dashboard Highlights
🔹 Performance Overview
Executive KPIs for quick assessment
Gender and performance distribution

🔹 Learning Behavior Analysis
Correlation between study habits and performance
Attendance impact visualization

🔹 Lifestyle & Risk Analysis
Screen time and sleep pattern insights
Early identification of students requiring intervention

🧠 Key Insights

Attendance and study hours have the strongest positive impact on exam scores
Excessive screen time correlates with lower academic performance
Balanced lifestyle habits are common among high performers
Early risk indicators can be identified before final exams

🎯 Business Value

Enables early academic intervention
Improves student outcome monitoring
Supports data-driven educational strategies
Converts behavioral data into decision-ready insights

📌 Resume-Ready Summary
